section 2.4. Set up CrowdFlower jobs and the database
according to requirement, you should provide a single command to call all these tasks. this is one of the major task.
-> Added "npm run resetJobs" command. The third command cannot auto run because it should be run after modified the configuration.


You must provide the script to remove the "access_token" and "refresh_token".
Or it fails all the time.
-> Asking in forum.


Perform following command:
$ npm run startWorkflow
$ npm run startIntegration
$ forever list
Shows that server and worker ¡°uptime¡± is ¡°STOPPED¡±
-> I cannot re-created this issue. It works if properly setup the configuration.


README.md is not updated.
-> Updated.


All modules must share the same access token and refresh token.
During running the instances, I found many duplicated files.
Why don't you use only one access_token and one refresh_token?
-> Asking in forum.


$ npm run startInstances
Above command is not successful every time.
Sometimes the access token is updated by one module.
The other modules still try using the old token.
-> Asking in forum.


RS asks to remove all existing DG. This is not properly handled.
-> Fixed.


workflow_manager/config/internal-jobs.example.json, any usage of this file?
-> It's used for internal jobs setting.


what is the resources folder used for?
-> Fixed.


jslint reports below error:
workflow_manager/services/CrowdFlowerService.js
#1 Unexpected 'call'.
    var aRequest = request[method].call(request, url); // Line 78, Pos 40
-> Fixed.


1, check following in 210749_sub/docs/DeploymentGuide.doc
--------
W1_INPUT corresponds to the standard_input folder while W2_OUTPUT corresponds to the standard_ output folder.
--------
but i can not find W1_INPUT, W2_OUTPUT in root/workflow_manager/test_files/config.js
Do you mean following configurations in root/workflow_manager/test_files/config.js ?
--------
line#24  CLIENT_A: {
        STANDARD_INPUT: 3596323200,
        STANDARD_OUTPUT: 3596324300
    }
--------
-> Fixed. Added "In url" text.


2, check 210749_foreverList_1.png
------
data:    [1] server            /usr/local/bin/node server.js            9334    9336    logs/server.log            STOPPED
data:    [2] worker            /usr/local/bin/node worker.js            9337    9339    logs/worker.log            STOPPED
------
i got following in 210749_sub/maintenance/logs/server.log
--------
info: Express server listening on port 4030 in development mode
-> Cannot re-created this issue. It works in my test.


check following in page6 in DG
-------
Finally, prepare your database. Run: 
$ node test_files/insert.js
-------
but there is no insert.js file under root/workflow_manager/test_files/ directory.
is insert.js a copy of root/workflow_manager/test_files/insert.example.js 
-> Fixed.


please provide a jslint check file lint.sh for *nix.
-> Asked in forum.


6, Following test in "cr-engrafa-30050933-suite/integration_manager/test/UserTest.js" is totally removed, and you did not provide equivalent test for 403 error.
--------
line#31    it('Should require admin user', function (done) {
        request(app)
            .get('/users')
            .set('Authorization', helper.token('user1', 'user1'))
            .expect(403, done);
    });
--------
-> This test case should be removed. The authorization part is by-pass in current test framework.


7, cr-engrafa-30050933-suite/resources/db-dumps is totally removed
-> Fixed.


210749_sub/maintenance/Maintenance.js, and 210749_sub/maintenance/instances.js have similar functionality.
1) Following function in these two files are exactly the same.
function executeCommand(command, skip, callback)
function stopAllInstances(callback)
function startAllInstances(callback)
2) Since Maintenance.js already contain stopAllInstances, and startAllInstances, i suggest combine these two files into one tool file.
3) At least, common function should be extracted to a common place.
4) To be consistent, Maintenance.js -> maintenance.js
-> 
1/2/3 Merged.
4. It's confirmed in previous assembly to use the name "Maintenance.js".


check following in EngrafaSuitePackageAssembly-RequirementsSpecification.pdf
------
e. Remove all existing Deployment Guides and provide a single Deployment Guide to prevent any confusions and provide only a single source of guiding the user on deployment.
------
But i can still find them in 210749_sub/docs/integration_manager_DG/, 210749_sub/docs/middleware_service_DG/, and 210749_sub/docs/workflow_manager_DG/
-> Fixed.


add the change log to the modified files, even though minor changes ar applied.
-> Fixed. Added in all files.


 $ grunt test
Running "mochaTest:test" (mochaTest) task
  APIController
    1) "before each" hook
  0 passing (88ms)
  1 failing
It is connection error. But I can connect to the mongoDB from the workflow
  1)  "before each" hook:
    Uncaught Error: failed to connect to [127.0.0.1:27017]
      at net.js:441:14
-> I cannot re-create this issue.


Deployment Guide 2.4
Finally, prepare your database. Run: 
$ node test_files/insert.js
Can not find the test_files/insert.js file
-> Fixed.


"W1_INPUT corresponds to the standard_input folder while W2_OUTPUT corresponds to the standard_ output folder."
i am somewhat confused, what is W1_INPUT/OUTPUT? i can not find from your submission.
-> Fixed.


"In addition to this, you need to copy the values to the access_token and refresh_token files respectively."
-> is this mandatory? afak, both files are created when the server is running.
-> Fixed. Added text "is getting error".


3. Database Setup
you should not simply say "None", it is confused, the user may think no database is used.
-> Fixed.


Grunt test.
When the instances are running.
$ node test_files/populate.js
reports connection closed error.
I must stop all instances first.
-> Fixed. Added text "In submission root directory, run ¡°forever stopall¡± to stop all instances before run test.".


1, for following in DG ?
These files in the ROOT directory (workflow_manager) itself.
------
what do you mean? Are these files in the ROOT directory, or in ROOT/workflow_manager ?
-> Fixed.
