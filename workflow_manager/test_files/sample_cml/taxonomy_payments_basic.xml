    <p><strong>Tip: </strong>Make sure the bill isn't just for half the tax year! If you see FIRST BILL or HALF TAX, one payment is NOT correct. DC, NH and IN are typically Two Payments NOT One Payment.</p>

  <cml:group only-if="paymentschedule:[1]" name="">
    <p><strong>Tip: </strong>Make sure the bill doesn't have just two of four payments. To verify it is only a two payment schedule, you should have found references to halves, 1st and 2nd, or fall and spring.</p>

  <cml:group only-if="paymentschedule:[2]" name="">
    <p><strong>Tip: </strong>To verify it is only a three pamyent schedule, you should have found references to 1/3 and 2/3 or thirds.</p>

  <cml:group only-if="paymentschedule:[3]" name="">
    <p><strong>Tip: </strong>To verify it is only a four payment schedule, you should have found references to quarters, or 1st 2nd 3rd and 4th.</p>

    <p><strong>Tip: </strong>Are you sure? There are very few bills where schedule cannot be determined. </p>
